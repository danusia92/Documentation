# Match User tells the SSH server to apply the following commands only to the user specified. Here, we specify sammyfiles.

# ForceCommand internal-sftp forces the SSH server to run the SFTP server upon login, disallowing shell access.

# PasswordAuthentication yes allows password authentication for this user.

# ChrootDirectory /var/sftp/ ensures that the user will not be allowed access to anything beyond the /var/sftp directory. You can learn more about chroot in this Ubuntu-based chroot tutorial.

# AllowAgentForwarding no, AllowTcpForwarding no. and X11Forwarding no disables port forwarding, tunneling and X11 forwarding for this user.
